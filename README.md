### *How to use?*
___

There is possibility to build library from source code, but other
option is to download release built version as static or shared
[library](https://github.com/xxxmonsterxxx/SGR/releases). It's necessary to download (or
include as submodule of git project) and include to your
project follows libraries:    
- **GLM** (https://github.com/g-truc/glm)
- **STB** (https://github.com/nothings/stb)
- **Vulkan** (https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk)
- **GLFW** (https://github.com/glfw/glfw)

Set path to `SGR-vX.X.X/include` as include path and
`SGR-vX.X.X/lib/static` or shared as external libraries
for your projects.

Manual documentation is currently unavailable. :cry:

### *How to build?*
___

For build need to install **Vulkan** and **GLFW** libraries.
Each build can be multithreaded, after "cmake"
command will be generated message with max number
of your threads.

#### *Environement:*

**Linux** (Check if your package system provides GLFW 3.3.6 or another version new enough to be useful to you)    
- install vulkan [SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/latest/linux/getting_started_ubuntu.html)
- `sudo apt install cmake` - install [CMake](https://cmake.org/) tools
- `sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev` - install [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)

MacOS & Linux & Windows build is the same:
```bash
cmake . -DRELEASE=TRUE -DVERSION=1.0.0 #if build for debug -> -DRELEASE=FALSE
make -j16 #number of your cores will be generated after "cmake"
```

For test of engine run build and launch the application:
```bash
cd examplesData
cmake .
make
cd build
./SGR_test
```
